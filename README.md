Trivia (Self-scoring)

## Project Description

- This will be a Spider-Man trivia game with difficulty levels of questions that allow for varying point levels. The game will allow the player to determine if their Spidey knowledge is at its peak or if they need to go back and read a few storylines in the comics to refresh their memory.
- The trivia game will be similar to jeopardy in that all of the questions will be available on the screen at once hidden by point levels, so the player may choose their questions by challenge/point level. There may be an option to make it a 2-player game so that Spidey fans may challenge others to trivia knowledge.
