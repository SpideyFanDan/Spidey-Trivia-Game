## Project Choice

Trivia (Self-scoring)

## Project Description

- This will be a Spider-Man trivia game with difficulty levels of questions that will eventually allow for varying point levels. The game will allow the player to determine if their Spidey knowledge is at its peak or if they need to go back and read a few storylines in the comics to refresh their memory. For its initial stages, it will be one point per question and there will be 15 questions.
- FUTURE GAME PLAY - The trivia game will eventually be similar to jeopardy in that all of the questions will be available on the screen at once hidden by point levels, so the player may choose their questions by challenge/point level. There may be an option to make it a 2-player game so that Spidey fans may challenge others to trivia knowledge.
